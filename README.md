Attendance management is important to every single organization; it can decide
whether or not an organization such as educational institutions, public or private
sectors will be successful in the future. Organizations will have to keep a track of
people within the organization such as employees and students to maximize their
performance. As the time for corresponding subject arrives the system automatically
starts taking snaps and then apply face detection and recognition technique to the
given image and the recognize students are marked as present and their attendance
update with corresponding time and subject id. We have used Open CV techniques to
develop this system, histogram of oriented gradient method is used to detect faces in
images and LBPH algorithm is used to compute and compare feature facial of students
to recognize them. Our system is capable to identify multiple faces in real time.
Instead of using the conventional methods, this proposed system aims to develop an
automated system that records the studentâ€™s attendance by using facial recognition
technology. The main objective of this work is to make the attendance marking and
management system efficient, time saving, simple and easy.
